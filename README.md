## Hello
---

I'm Sophie, a Full Stack Software Developer, recently graduated from [Makers](https://makers.tech/) Bootcamp. I'm currently looking for a role where I can apply my programming skills to new and evolving challenges within a team environment that champions the open discourse of ideas and values continuous learning.

I have historically crafted rather the portfolio career, relishing new experiences and variety, as such I excel in handling novel and unexpected challenges. I am very accustomed to entering new situations, quickly assimilating information, planning and executing rapidly to meet deadlines. I will thrive in a role that gives me opportunities to develop and constantly invest the dividends of my ongoing educational escapades.
